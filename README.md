# James Ryan's Portfolio Project (Week 2)

## What is This Project?

This week's homework is a personal portfolio website created from scratch, showcasing my skills and projects.

- **Why Did I Make This?**: To build a professional portfolio to showcase to potential employers that highlights my work in HTML, CSS, and responsive design.
- **What's in It?**: The portfolio includes sections about me, my work, contact information, resume, and projects.
- **What Did I Learn?**: This project helped me understand the importance of having a well showcased portfolio, and also the use of CSS techniques for a flexible and responsive design.
