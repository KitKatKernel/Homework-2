                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Hey there, I’m James F. Ryan IV! Right now, I’m deep into a Fullstack Bootcamp, aiming to become a junior web developer by the end of the year. I enjoy nothing more than solving tough problems and teaming up to cook up creative solutions in my day to day life. I love setting up cool and unique projects on my computer that I can access from anywhere on all my devices, it’s just so satisfying when it all comes together!</p>

                    <h2>Work</h2>
                        <p>Currently, I'm balancing my role at Target with this part-time Fullstack Bootcamp. I've been with Target for nearly a decade, steering our grocery department through its daily challenges.. Which has been no small feat with our small staff! These days, although my knees aren't what they used to be (they sound like chalk snapping when I get up!), I'm ready to shift gears from retail to tech. My fascination with tech started back when AOL 2.0 was all the rage in '96 when I was 8, and I've been a tech enthusiast ever since. I'm excited to swap my store gloves for a keyboard and mouse, where I can really unleash my creativity.</p>
